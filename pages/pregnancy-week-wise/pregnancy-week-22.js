      title: "Pregnancy Week 22: Advanced Sensory Development and Movement Patterns",
      content: `
Welcome to Week 22 of your pregnancy journey. You are now well into the second half of your pregnancy, with your baby demonstrating increasingly sophisticated sensory responses and movement patterns that reflect remarkable neurological development. This week marks significant advancements in sensory integration, tactile sensitivity, and the emergence of more distinct behavioral patterns that provide glimpses into your baby's developing personality and preferences.

Your baby has grown to approximately the size of a spaghetti squash, measuring about 7.5-8 inches (19-20.5 cm) from crown to rump and weighing around 15-16 ounces (430-460 grams). The most notable development this week involves the refinement of sensory capabilities, particularly touch sensitivity and visual development. Your baby's skin is becoming more sensitive to touch, and the eyes, though still fused shut, are developing increased light sensitivity and the ability to perceive changes in brightness.

For most expectant mothers, week 22 brings consistently strong fetal movements that demonstrate clear patterns and responses to external stimuli. These movements have evolved beyond random activity to include more deliberate actions and responses to sounds, touch, and even light. Many women find that their babies develop distinct activity rhythms, with particular times of day becoming consistently active and responses to specific stimuli becoming more predictable. The movements may now be strong enough to create visible distortions of your abdominal contour and be easily felt by others.

This week also represents continued maturation of your baby's organ systems, particularly the respiratory and digestive systems, as preparation for extrauterine life progresses. Understanding the significant developments occurring during week 22 can help you appreciate this special phase of pregnancy and prepare for the continued growth and changes in the coming weeks as you approach the final months of pregnancy.

      title: "Fetal Development: Major Milestones in Week 22",
      content: `
Week 22 represents a period of sophisticated sensory development and physical maturation in your baby's growth journey. The foundational systems established during earlier weeks are now demonstrating advanced integration and coordination, with particular emphasis on sensory processing, movement refinement, and the development of more complex physiological functions.

Your baby's sensory development shows remarkable advancement during week 22, with tactile sensitivity becoming increasingly refined. The skin is developing more nerve endings, making your baby more responsive to touch and pressure. Your baby can feel their own body, the uterine walls, and the umbilical cord, and may respond to external touch on your abdomen. This developing tactile sensitivity represents the foundation for the important bonding that occurs through touch after birth. The sensory information gathered through touch also contributes to your baby's developing body awareness and spatial orientation.

Visual development continues during week 22, with the eyes becoming more light-sensitive despite remaining fused shut. The retinas are developing increased numbers of light-sensitive cells, and the neural connections between the eyes and brain are becoming more sophisticated. Your baby may respond to bright light directed at your abdomen with movement changes, though vision remains limited to perceiving changes in brightness rather than distinct images. The development of visual capabilities, though primitive at this stage, represents the beginning of the complex visual system that will continue to mature throughout pregnancy and infancy.

The muscular system demonstrates impressive coordination and strength during week 22. Your baby's movements are becoming more purposeful, varied, and responsive to both internal and external stimuli. The development of muscle tissue and the maturation of the nervous system allow for complex movement patterns including stretching, kicking, rolling, grasping, and even responding to sounds or touch with deliberate actions. These movement patterns are essential for proper joint development, muscular strength, and neuromuscular coordination. The practice of these movements in the amniotic fluid environment continues to develop the proprioceptive system and spatial awareness.

The skeletal system continues its important development during week 22 as the process of ossification advances. The bones are becoming increasingly hardened and structured while maintaining the flexibility needed for the birth process. This skeletal maturation is evident throughout the body, with particular progress in the vertebrae, ribs, and limb bones. The bone marrow remains the primary site of blood cell production, efficiently creating red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets to support your baby's growing circulatory system and immune development.

The nervous system shows extraordinary development during week 22 as the brain continues to grow rapidly and increase in complexity. The cerebral cortex is developing more pronounced grooves and ridges that increase its surface area and processing capacity. The different regions of the brain are becoming more specialized in their functions, with particular development in areas responsible for sensory processing, motor coordination, and basic cognitive functions. Myelin—the protective coating that insulates nerve fibers and speeds neural transmission—continues to form around nerves, significantly improving the efficiency of neural communication and enabling more sophisticated sensory-motor integration.

The digestive system continues to mature significantly during week 22. The intestines are developing the characteristic looping pattern that will allow for efficient nutrient absorption after birth. Meconium continues to accumulate in the intestines, and the digestive organs are practicing their functions. Your baby swallows amniotic fluid regularly, which helps the digestive system develop and contributes to the development of taste preferences based on flavors transmitted through the amniotic fluid. The swallowing reflex is becoming more coordinated, and your baby may demonstrate preferences for certain flavors based on your diet.

The respiratory system shows important development during week 22 as the lungs continue to mature. The bronchial tree is developing more branches, and the cells that produce surfactant—the substance that helps the air sacs inflate properly—are becoming more active. While the lungs are not yet capable of functioning outside the womb, these developments represent crucial steps toward respiratory viability. Your baby practices breathing movements by inhaling and exhaling amniotic fluid, which helps develop the respiratory muscles and coordination needed for breathing after birth. These practice movements are becoming more regular and coordinated.

Fat development continues during week 22, with both brown and white fat deposition progressing steadily beneath the skin. Brown fat, which generates heat through non-shivering thermogenesis, is particularly important for temperature regulation after birth. White fat provides energy storage and insulation. As fat accumulation increases, your baby's appearance becomes smoother and more filled out. The continued development of fat stores represents crucial progress toward your baby's ability to regulate body temperature and maintain energy reserves after birth.

Your baby's unique features continue to become more defined during week 22. The eyebrows and eyelashes are well-developed, and the hair on the scalp is becoming more substantial. The lanugo—the fine, downy hair covering the body—continues to provide protection and help regulate temperature. The vernix caseosa—the waxy, protective coating on the skin—is becoming more substantial, providing crucial protection from the amniotic fluid. The facial features are becoming more refined and distinctive, and your baby may begin to demonstrate more varied facial expressions as the facial muscles develop coordination.

      title: "Maternal Changes and Symptoms in Week 22",
      content: `
Your body continues to adapt to pregnancy during week 22, with the physical changes becoming more pronounced and the interactive dimension of pregnancy becoming increasingly meaningful through responsive fetal movements and developing sensory connections.

Many women experience generally good energy levels during week 22, though the physical demands of supporting a rapidly growing baby may manifest as increased fatigue, particularly later in the day or after physical activity. The completely symptom-free period of early second trimester may be transitioning as your baby's increasing size and your changing body mechanics create new physical sensations. However, most women still feel significantly more energetic than during the first trimester and are able to maintain their usual activities with appropriate modifications and pacing.

Your uterus continues its upward expansion, typically reaching about 2-2.5 inches (5-6 cm) above your navel. This growth makes your baby bump prominently visible and may begin to affect your breathing as the uterus puts gentle pressure on your diaphragm. The fundal height—the distance from your pubic bone to the top of your uterus—continues to increase and is often measured during prenatal visits to track growth. As your uterus expands, you might continue experiencing round ligament pain, though many women find these sensations have become more manageable or have transitioned to general stretching discomfort.

The most rewarding development for many women during week 22 is the responsiveness and pattern development of fetal movements. These movements are typically strong, frequent, and demonstrate increasing coordination and responsiveness to external stimuli. Many women find that movement patterns are becoming more predictable, with active periods often occurring after meals, when resting, or in response to specific stimuli like sounds, touch, or light. The movements may now be strong enough to create visible distortions of your abdominal contour and be easily felt by others, creating opportunities for shared experiences and bonding with your partner, family members, and friends.

Breast changes continue during week 22, with many women noticing ongoing growth and preparation for lactation. The areolas typically remain darkened and may continue to enlarge. Montgomery's tubercles stay prominent, and some women may notice colostrum leakage, particularly with breast stimulation or later in the day. These changes are normal and indicate that your body is preparing for breastfeeding.

Your cardiovascular system continues to work at an increased capacity to support your pregnancy, with blood volume now approximately 45-50% above pre-pregnancy levels. This increased circulation can cause various symptoms including nasal congestion, occasional nosebleeds, and visible veins, particularly in the breasts, abdomen, and legs. Your heart rate may remain slightly elevated, and you might notice that you feel warmer than usual due to increased metabolism and blood flow.

Some women experience headaches during week 22, which can be caused by hormonal changes, increased blood volume, sinus congestion, or tension. Most pregnancy headaches are normal, but severe or persistent headaches should be discussed with your healthcare provider. Dehydration can exacerbate headaches, so maintaining adequate fluid intake remains important.

Your digestive system continues to be affected by pregnancy hormones and physical changes. Progesterone continues to relax smooth muscles throughout your body, including those in your digestive tract, which can slow digestion and contribute to constipation. The growing uterus puts increasing pressure on your stomach and intestines, which can worsen heartburn or indigestion. Eating smaller, more frequent meals and staying hydrated can help manage these symptoms.

Many women notice that their center of gravity continues to shift noticeably during week 22 as the uterus expands upward and forward. This change can affect balance and posture, potentially leading to back discomfort or changes in gait. Some women may develop a more pronounced waddle as they unconsciously adjust their walking pattern to accommodate their changing shape. Practicing good posture and wearing supportive shoes can help manage these changes.

Skin changes may become more pronounced during week 22. Many women notice the linea nigra—the dark line running from the navel to the pubic bone—becoming more visible. Stretch marks may become more apparent on the abdomen, breasts, hips, or thighs as the skin stretches to accommodate growth. These changes are normal and typically fade after pregnancy.

Emotional changes during week 22 often include a mix of excitement, connection, and occasional anxiety as the reality of impending parenthood becomes increasingly tangible. The strong, responsive movements provide ongoing reassurance and connection, while the physical changes serve as constant reminders of the significant transition ahead. Many women find themselves thinking more concretely about practical preparations and emotional adjustments as they move further into the second half of pregnancy.

      title: "Nutrition and Health Guidelines for Week 22",
      content: `
Proper nutrition during week 22 remains crucial to support your baby's rapid growth and development, particularly the ongoing maturation of sensory systems, neurological development, and continued physical growth. Your nutritional needs remain elevated as your baby undergoes significant developmental advancements.

Continue taking your prenatal vitamin daily, ensuring it contains adequate folic acid (400-800 mcg), iron (27 mg), calcium (1,000 mg), and DHA (200-300 mg). These nutrients support ongoing fetal development, particularly brain development, bone formation, and blood production. The DHA is especially important as your baby's nervous system undergoes sophisticated development and sensory refinement this week.

Protein requirements remain elevated during week 22 to support your baby's rapid growth and your expanding blood volume. Aim for approximately 75-100 grams of protein daily from sources like lean meats, poultry, fish (low-mercury varieties), eggs, dairy products, legumes, nuts, and tofu. Protein is essential for tissue building, placenta development, and helping your body manage increased metabolic demands.

Calcium intake continues to be crucial during week 22 to support your baby's skeletal development and ongoing bone ossification. Aim for 1,000 mg of calcium daily from sources like dairy products, fortified plant milks, leafy greens, tofu, and calcium-fortified foods. Adequate calcium intake also helps protect your own bone density during pregnancy. Vitamin D supports calcium absorption, so ensure you're getting adequate sunlight exposure or consuming vitamin D-rich foods like fortified dairy, eggs, and fatty fish.

Iron needs remain significantly increased during pregnancy to support expanded blood volume and prevent anemia. Include iron-rich foods in your diet such as lean red meat, poultry, fish, lentils, spinach, and iron-fortified cereals. Consuming vitamin C-rich foods alongside iron-rich foods can enhance iron absorption. Your healthcare provider will monitor your iron levels and may recommend supplements if needed.

Healthy fats continue to be important during week 22 as your baby develops fat stores and continues brain and sensory development. Include sources of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA, for your baby's brain and eye development. Good sources include low-mercury fish (salmon, sardines), walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds. Other healthy fats from avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil support overall development and help your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins.

Fiber intake remains important as pregnancy progresses to help manage constipation, which can be exacerbated by progesterone's effect on digestive muscles and pressure from the growing uterus. Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts in your diet. Adequate fluid intake is essential when increasing fiber to prevent digestive discomfort and support healthy bowel function.

Hydration is crucial during week 22 to support increased blood volume, maintain amniotic fluid levels, prevent urinary tract infections, and manage constipation. Aim for 8-10 glasses of fluid daily, primarily from water. Herbal teas, broth-based soups, and water-rich fruits and vegetables can contribute to your fluid intake. Pay attention to urine color—pale yellow indicates adequate hydration.

Continue avoiding alcohol, recreational drugs, and smoking, as these can harm fetal development. Limit caffeine to less than 200 mg daily (approximately one 12-ounce cup of coffee). Avoid high-mercury fish, raw or undercooked meats and eggs, unpasteurized dairy products, and deli meats unless heated thoroughly. Practice good food safety habits to reduce infection risk.

If you're experiencing heartburn or indigestion, eat smaller, more frequent meals and avoid lying down immediately after eating. Identify and avoid trigger foods that worsen your symptoms. Some women find that sleeping with extra pillows to elevate the upper body helps reduce nighttime heartburn. Discuss safe antacid options with your healthcare provider if symptoms are bothersome.

Pay attention to how your eating patterns relate to fetal movements. Many women notice that their babies become more active after meals, particularly those containing natural sugars or complex carbohydrates. This pattern is normal and can provide reassurance about your baby's wellbeing. Noting these patterns can also help you identify your baby's unique activity rhythms and preferences.

      title: "Medical Care and Prenatal Visits",
      content: `
Week 22 continues to be an important time for prenatal care, with regular monitoring ensuring that both you and your baby remain healthy as you progress further into the second half of your pregnancy.

During prenatal visits around week 22, your healthcare provider will typically continue monitoring your overall health and the progression of your pregnancy. This may include checking your weight, blood pressure, and measuring fundal height (the distance from your pubic bone to the top of your uterus) to assess fetal growth. Your provider will discuss any symptoms you're experiencing and address your questions or concerns, particularly regarding fetal movement patterns and any physical discomfort you may be experiencing.

Your healthcare provider will listen to your baby's heartbeat using a Doppler device during your week 22 appointment. The heartbeat is typically strong and regular, ranging from 120-160 beats per minute. Finding the heartbeat is usually straightforward now as your baby is larger and the uterus is positioned higher in the abdomen. The strong, regular heartbeat provides important reassurance of your baby's wellbeing.

If you haven't yet completed your anatomy scan ultrasound or if follow-up examinations are needed, these may be scheduled around week 22. This detailed examination assesses fetal development comprehensively and provides valuable information about your baby's growth and organ development. Any findings from previous ultrasounds will be reviewed, and your provider will discuss any recommended follow-up care or monitoring.

Depending on your individual circumstances and previous test results, your provider may discuss or review second-trimester screening tests. If any abnormalities were detected during your anatomy scan or if you have risk factors that require additional monitoring, your provider will discuss these findings and any recommended follow-up testing or consultations with specialists.

Your healthcare provider will assess your symptoms and provide guidance on managing common second-trimester concerns like back pain, round ligament discomfort, skin changes, and digestive issues. They can recommend safe strategies and treatments for managing discomfort and maintaining wellbeing during this stage of pregnancy. Don't hesitate to discuss any symptoms, even if they seem minor or routine.

Laboratory tests may be reviewed or ordered, including blood tests to monitor iron levels, thyroid function, and other health indicators. Urine tests may check for protein, sugar, and signs of infection. If you're Rh-negative, your provider may discuss Rh immunoglobulin administration, typically given around 28 weeks but sometimes earlier if needed.

Your provider will discuss important lifestyle considerations, nutritional recommendations, and warning signs to watch for as your pregnancy progresses into the second half. This is an excellent time to ask questions about exercise recommendations, travel considerations, workplace accommodations, and preparation for upcoming developmental milestones. Bring a list of questions to ensure you cover all your concerns.

If you have chronic health conditions, your provider will continue to monitor these and adjust management strategies as needed. They'll review any medications or supplements you're taking to ensure they remain appropriate for your stage of pregnancy. Your provider may also discuss planning for upcoming prenatal care, including the schedule for future appointments and tests as you move closer to the third trimester.

Your healthcare provider may provide additional resources for childbirth education, breastfeeding support, and other pregnancy-related services as you progress further into your pregnancy. They can recommend reputable sources of information and support services in your community. This is also a good time to discuss your birth preferences and continue developing your birth plan in more detail.

The development of the somatosensory system—which processes touch, temperature, and pain—is becoming more sophisticated, enabling your baby to perceive and respond to different types of tactile stimulation.

Visual development continues during week 22, with the eyes becoming more light-sensitive despite remaining fused shut. The retinas are developing increased numbers of light-sensitive cells, particularly rods and cones, and the neural connections between the eyes and brain are becoming more sophisticated. Your baby may respond to bright light directed at your abdomen with movement changes, though vision remains limited to perceiving changes in brightness rather than distinct images. The development of visual capabilities, though primitive at this stage, represents the beginning of the complex visual system that will continue to mature throughout pregnancy and infancy. The eyes are also developing the ability to move in coordinated patterns, though voluntary control remains limited.

      title: "Frequently Asked Questions About Week 22 Pregnancy",
      content: `
Many women have questions and concerns during week 22 as they experience increasingly responsive fetal movements and progress further into the second half of pregnancy.

How responsive should my baby be to external stimuli at 22 weeks?
At 22 weeks, many babies demonstrate clear responses to external stimuli like sounds, touch, and light. You may notice increased movement in response to loud noises, calming with familiar voices, or movement changes when you apply gentle pressure to your abdomen. These responses indicate developing sensory integration and neurological maturation.

Is it normal to see visible movements from the outside?
Yes, it's completely normal to see visible movements from the outside at 22 weeks. As your baby grows stronger, their movements can create visible distortions of your abdominal contour. These visible movements often become more pronounced in the coming weeks and can be a wonderful way for others to share in your pregnancy experience.

How much weight should I have gained by week 22?
Weight gain varies, but typical recommendations suggest gaining about 1-2 pounds per month during the first trimester and approximately 1 pound per week during the second trimester. By week 22, many women have gained between 13-18 pounds, but individual patterns vary based on pre-pregnancy weight, metabolism, and other factors.

Can my baby really taste what I eat?
While your baby doesn't taste food directly, flavors from your diet are transmitted through the amniotic fluid. Research suggests that babies can detect these flavors and may develop preferences based on this early exposure. This early sensory experience may influence food preferences after birth.

What does it mean if my baby has quiet days?
It's normal for babies to have quieter days mixed with more active days. Your baby has sleep-wake cycles and may be less active during growth spurts or after particularly active periods. However, if you notice a significant decrease in movement from established patterns, contact your healthcare provider.

Is back pain normal at 22 weeks?
Yes, back pain is common during pregnancy as your uterus expands and your center of gravity shifts. The hormone relaxin, which loosens ligaments in preparation for birth, can also contribute. Practice good posture, wear supportive shoes, and consider gentle stretches or prenatal yoga to help manage discomfort.

When should I start childbirth education classes?
Many childbirth education classes are designed to be completed in the third trimester, but week 22 is a good time to research options and register. Classes typically cover labor, delivery, pain management options, and newborn care, providing valuable preparation for birth and early parenting.

When should I contact my healthcare provider between appointments?
Contact your provider for heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, fever over 100.4°F, persistent vomiting, significantly decreased fetal movement (if you've been feeling regular movements), painful urination, or signs of preterm labor. For less urgent concerns, call during office hours.

What preparations should I be making now?
Week 22 is a good time to continue concrete preparations like researching childbirth education classes, developing your birth plan, and considering practical arrangements for maternity leave and baby equipment. Many women also begin more detailed nursery planning and discussing parenting approaches with their partners.

Can my baby's activity patterns predict their sleep patterns after birth?
While there may be some continuity between fetal activity patterns and newborn sleep patterns, many factors influence newborn sleep including feeding patterns, environment, and individual temperament. Fetal activity patterns primarily reflect neurological development rather than established sleep preferences.

      title: "Professional Tips for Navigating Week 22 Successfully",
      content: `
Implementing strategic approaches during week 22 can support both your physical wellbeing and emotional adjustment to pregnancy while ensuring optimal conditions for your developing fetus during this period of advanced sensory development and movement patterns.

Establish meaningful sensory interactions with your baby by engaging multiple senses. Talk or sing to your baby, play different types of music, gently massage your abdomen, and notice how your baby responds to different types of stimulation. These interactions can enhance bonding and provide valuable information about your baby's developing preferences and patterns. Pay attention to what types of stimulation seem to calm or stimulate your baby, as these patterns may continue after birth.

Continue focusing on optimal nutrition with particular emphasis on foods that support neurological development and sensory maturation. Ensure you're consuming adequate protein, healthy fats, and essential vitamins and minerals. The variety in your diet exposes your baby to different flavors through the amniotic fluid, which may influence food preferences after birth. Pay attention to how different foods affect your energy levels and your baby's movement patterns.

Address the physical changes of pregnancy proactively as your center of gravity continues to shift and your baby bump becomes more pronounced. Pay extra attention to posture and body mechanics, particularly when getting up from seated positions or bending. Consider maternity support belts if you're experiencing significant back discomfort. Develop a comfortable sleep routine that includes side sleeping with supportive pillows between your knees and under your abdomen.

Continue documenting your pregnancy journey systematically, noting physical changes, emotional experiences, questions for your healthcare provider, and special moments like particularly responsive movements or patterns you notice. Many women find that recording their experiences helps process the emotional aspects of pregnancy and creates a precious record of this transformative time. Consider taking weekly photos to visually document your changing body.

Strengthen your support system as you move further into the second half of pregnancy. Maintain connections with people who can help with practical tasks and those who provide emotional understanding. Consider joining a pregnancy support group or online community to connect with other women at similar stages. Continue communicating clearly with your partner about what support you need most as your pregnancy progresses.

Continue concrete preparations for your baby's arrival by researching childbirth education options and considering registering for sessions in the coming weeks. Develop your birth plan in more detail, considering your preferences for pain management, delivery positions, and immediate postpartum care. Research practical considerations like maternity leave arrangements, baby equipment needs, and nursery planning.

Practice proactive healthcare by keeping all prenatal appointments and following your provider's recommendations. Don't hesitate to contact your healthcare provider with questions or concerns between appointments, especially as you notice new symptoms or have questions about fetal development. Keep a list of emergency contacts, including your provider's after-hours number, readily available.

Finally, take time to enjoy and appreciate the increasingly sophisticated interactions with your baby. The sensory responsiveness and movement patterns you're experiencing represent remarkable developmental progress. These interactions provide wonderful reassurance and connection during this special time as you progress further into the second half of your pregnancy journey.

      title: "Looking Ahead: Continuing Fetal Development",
      content: `
Understanding what lies ahead can help you prepare for the continuing developments in the second half of your pregnancy and appreciate the progression of your baby's growth in the coming weeks.

In week 23, your baby will continue rapid development with further refinement of sensory capabilities and physical features. The vernix caseosa will become more substantial, providing increased protection for the skin. Your baby's movements will become even stronger and more coordinated, and you may begin to notice more consistent responses to external stimuli like sounds, light, or touch.

The second trimester will continue through week 27, with many women experiencing generally good energy levels and decreasing early pregnancy symptoms. However, as your baby grows larger, you may begin to experience new physical sensations like increased back discomfort, leg cramps, or more pronounced changes in your center of gravity. Understanding these normal changes can help you manage them effectively.

Throughout the remaining weeks of the second trimester, your baby will experience tremendous growth and development. Major milestones in the coming weeks include continued brain development, lung maturation, and increased fat deposition. The sensory systems will continue refining, with hearing becoming more acute and the eyes developing further. Your baby's sleep-wake cycles will become more defined, and movement patterns will become increasingly consistent.

Your body will continue to change significantly as your uterus expands upward and your baby bump becomes more pronounced. You may experience new symptoms like increased shortness of breath as your uterus presses against your diaphragm, or more noticeable swelling in your feet and ankles. Understanding these normal changes can help you manage discomfort and recognize when to seek medical advice.

Remember that pregnancy progression varies for every woman and every pregnancy. Try to avoid comparing your experience to others' or to what you read in books or online. Trust your body's wisdom, listen to its signals, and maintain open communication with your healthcare provider throughout your pregnancy journey.

Week 22 represents a period of advanced sensory development and movement patterns, with your baby developing increasingly sophisticated capabilities and your body adapting to support this development. This phase marks continued progress in the second half of pregnancy and represents a special time to connect with your baby through their developing sensory responsiveness and movement coordination.

  const faqs = [
    {
      q: "What are the most important developments happening in week 22?",
      a: "Week 22 is crucial for advanced sensory development, particularly tactile sensitivity and visual refinement. Movements become more responsive to external stimuli, the nervous system shows significant development in sensory integration, and all major organ systems continue maturing in preparation for extrauterine life."
    },
    {
      q: "How responsive should my baby be to external stimuli at 22 weeks?",
      a: "At 22 weeks, many babies demonstrate clear responses to external stimuli like sounds, touch, and light. You may notice increased movement in response to loud noises, calming with familiar voices, or movement changes when you apply gentle pressure to your abdomen. These responses indicate developing sensory integration."
    },
    {
      q: "Is it normal to see visible movements from the outside?",
      a: "Yes, it's completely normal to see visible movements from the outside at 22 weeks. As your baby grows stronger, their movements can create visible distortions of your abdominal contour. These visible movements often become more pronounced in the coming weeks."
    },
    {
      q: "How much weight should I have gained by week 22?",
      a: "Weight gain varies, but typical recommendations suggest gaining about 1-2 pounds per month during the first trimester and approximately 1 pound per week during the second trimester. By week 22, many women have gained between 13-18 pounds, but individual patterns vary."
    },
    {
      q: "Can my baby really taste what I eat?",
      a: "While your baby doesn't taste food directly, flavors from your diet are transmitted through the amniotic fluid. Research suggests that babies can detect these flavors and may develop preferences based on this early exposure. This early sensory experience may influence food preferences after birth."
    },
    {
      q: "What does it mean if my baby has quiet days?",
      a: "It's normal for babies to have quieter days mixed with more active days. Your baby has sleep-wake cycles and may be less active during growth spurts or after particularly active periods. However, if you notice a significant decrease in movement from established patterns, contact your healthcare provider."
    },
    {
      q: "Is back pain normal at 22 weeks?",
      a: "Yes, back pain is common during pregnancy as your uterus expands and your center of gravity shifts. The hormone relaxin, which loosens ligaments in preparation for birth, can also contribute. Practice good posture and consider gentle stretches to help manage discomfort."
    },
    {
      q: "When should I start childbirth education classes?",
      a: "Many childbirth education classes are designed to be completed in the third trimester, but week 22 is a good time to research options and register. Classes typically cover labor, delivery, pain management options, and newborn care."
    },
    {
      q: "When should I contact my healthcare provider between appointments?",
      a: "Contact your provider for heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, fever over 100.4°F, persistent vomiting, significantly decreased fetal movement, painful urination, or signs of preterm labor. For less urgent concerns, call during office hours."
    },
    {
      q: "What preparations should I be making now?",
      a: "Week 22 is a good time to continue concrete preparations like researching childbirth education classes, developing your birth plan, and considering practical arrangements for maternity leave and baby equipment. Many women also begin more detailed nursery planning."
