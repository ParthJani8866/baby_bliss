      content: `
        Welcome to **Week 5 of pregnancy**, the milestone when many women finally confirm what they’ve been hoping (or suspecting) — a positive test.  
        At this stage, your body is producing high levels of **hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin)**, which not only supports your baby’s growth but also triggers many of those early pregnancy symptoms.  

        While it may still feel surreal, this is a week of transformation: your baby’s heart is forming, your hormones are shifting dramatically, and your emotional journey as a mom-to-be is truly beginning.

        Even though your baby is still extremely small, incredible things are happening.  

        - **Size:** About the size of a sesame seed (1.5–2 mm).  
        - **Heart Formation:** The heart is developing and may start beating around the end of this week, though it might not be visible on ultrasound just yet.  
        - **Neural Tube:** The foundation of the brain and spinal cord is forming — making **folic acid** intake especially critical.  
        - **Circulatory System:** Primitive blood vessels are developing, beginning the process of delivering oxygen and nutrients.  
        - **Placenta & Umbilical Cord:** These are taking shape to sustain your baby throughout pregnancy.  
        - **Limb Buds:** Tiny buds are starting to appear where arms and legs will form.  

        Your baby may still be invisible to the naked eye, but the groundwork for every organ is being laid right now.

        The hormonal surge — especially hCG, estrogen, and progesterone — is in full swing this week.  

        **Common Week 5 symptoms:**  
        - 🚫 **Missed period** — the first sign that leads most women to test.  
        - 🤢 **Nausea & vomiting** — commonly known as “morning sickness,” though it can strike any time of day.  
        - 😴 **Extreme fatigue** — your body is working overtime to support your baby.  
        - 👙 **Breast changes** — tenderness, heaviness, and darker areolas.  
        - 💧 **Frequent urination** — hormones increase blood flow to your kidneys.  
        - 😭 **Mood swings** — heightened emotions due to hormonal fluctuations.  
        - 🌡️ **Mild cramping** — as your uterus expands (should not be severe).  

        👉 Don’t panic if you don’t feel many symptoms yet — every woman’s journey is unique.

        By now, you likely have a **positive home pregnancy test**. What’s next?  

        - ✅ **Blood test**: Confirms pregnancy and measures exact hCG levels.  
        - 📅 **Prenatal appointment**: Most doctors schedule the first visit between weeks 6–8.  
        - 📊 **hCG monitoring**: If you’ve had fertility treatments, recurrent miscarriages, or complications before, your doctor may monitor hormone levels closely.  
        - 🩺 **Early ultrasound**: May be suggested if you’re high risk, but usually it’s done around 6–8 weeks to detect heartbeat.  

        **Tip:** Start writing down questions for your doctor — about nutrition, exercise, or medications.

        "At 5 weeks, I took my second pregnancy test just to be sure. The line was bold this time, but my heart was racing.  
        I wanted to feel pure excitement, but instead I felt anxiety — 'Am I ready? What if something goes wrong?'  

        My husband hugged me and said, 'We’ll figure it out together.' That’s when the tears came — tears of relief and joy.  
        I realized that pregnancy isn’t just about a baby growing, it’s about us growing into parents."
