  const faqs = [
    {
      q: "My baby hasn't rolled over yet. Should I be worried?",
      a: "Not at all! Rolling typically happens between 4-6 months, but every baby develops at their own pace. Some babies skip rolling altogether and move straight to sitting or crawling. Focus on providing plenty of supervised tummy time and celebrate other milestones like improved head control. If your baby shows no interest in moving or seems unusually stiff by 6 months, consult your pediatrician."
    },
    {
      q: "Is the 4-month sleep regression real? Why is my baby waking up more?",
      a: "Yes, but it's actually a 'sleep progression' - your baby's brain is maturing! They're transitioning from newborn sleep cycles to more adult-like patterns with distinct light and deep sleep phases. This means they wake briefly between cycles and may need help settling back to sleep. This is a normal developmental phase that usually passes in 2-6 weeks with consistent routines."
    },
    {
      q: "How much should my 4-month-old be sleeping?",
      a: "Most 4-month-olds need 12-15 hours of sleep total, with 6-8 hour stretches at night becoming more common (though not guaranteed!). Daytime naps typically total 3-4 hours across 3-4 naps. Remember, sleep needs vary greatly - watch for sleepy cues rather than following strict schedules."
    },
    {
      q: "My baby is drooling and chewing everything - are they teething?",
      a: "Probably! While some babies don't get their first tooth until 6-7 months, teething symptoms can start months earlier. Signs include excessive drooling, gum rubbing, chewing on everything, irritability, and sometimes mild fever. Offer chilled (not frozen) teething toys and gentle gum massage for relief."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I start my 4-month-old on solid foods?",
      a: "Most pediatricians recommend waiting until 6 months. At 4 months, your baby's digestive system is still maturing. Look for readiness signs: sitting with minimal support, good head control, loss of tongue-thrust reflex, and showing interest in your food. Always consult your pediatrician before starting solids."
    },
    {
      q: "Why is my baby so distracted during feedings?",
      a: "This is completely normal! Your baby's curiosity about the world is exploding. They're easily distracted by sounds, movements, and new sights. Try feeding in a quiet, dimly lit room with minimal distractions. If breastfeeding, you might notice shorter, more efficient feeds as your baby becomes more skilled at extracting milk."
    },
    {
      q: "How can I help my baby develop rolling skills?",
      a: "Provide plenty of supervised tummy time on a firm surface. Place interesting toys just out of reach to encourage reaching and turning. Gently guide their hips during tummy time to show them the rolling motion. Most importantly, be patient and celebrate small progress!"
    },
    {
      q: "Is it normal for my baby to prefer standing or sitting rather than tummy time?",
      a: "Yes! Many babies enjoy the new perspective of being upright. Supported sitting and standing (with you holding them) helps develop leg and core strength. However, continue tummy time as it's crucial for developing the muscles needed for rolling, crawling, and eventual walking."
    },
    {
      q: "My baby's hair is falling out - is this normal?",
      a: "Yes, this is very common postpartum hair shedding. During pregnancy, high estrogen levels kept hair in the growth phase. Now that hormones are stabilizing, all that extra hair is shedding. It usually peaks around month 4 and should normalize by months 6-9. Your hair will return to its normal growth cycle."
    },
    {
      q: "When should I stop swaddling my baby?",
      a: "Stop swaddling as soon as your baby shows signs of rolling over (usually around 4 months). Swaddling restricts arm movement, which babies need to roll back over or adjust their position for safe sleep. Transition to a wearable sleep sack or sleep bag for warmth and safety."
    },
    {
      q: "How much should my 4-month-old be eating?",
      a: "Breastfed babies typically feed 6-8 times daily (10-15 minutes per side), while formula-fed babies take 4-6 ounces every 3-4 hours. Your baby is becoming more efficient at feeding, so sessions may be shorter but more effective. Watch for hunger cues rather than watching the clock."
    },
    {
      q: "What toys are best for a 4-month-old?",
      a: "Great options include: activity gyms with hanging toys, easy-to-grasp rattles, textured balls, soft books with high-contrast images, unbreakable mirrors, and teething toys. Your baby is now reaching, grabbing, and exploring everything with their mouth!"
    },
    {
      q: "Why does my baby keep putting everything in their mouth?",
      a: "This is how babies explore the world! Their mouths have more nerve endings than their hands, making oral exploration the primary way they learn about textures, shapes, and temperatures. Ensure all toys are safe, clean, and too large to swallow."
    },
    {
      q: "How can I establish a good routine at 4 months?",
      a: "Focus on consistent wake-up times, feeding schedules, and bedtime routines rather than rigid schedules. Follow an 'eat-play-sleep' pattern, watch for sleepy cues, and create calming pre-nap and bedtime rituals. Be flexible - growth spurts and developmental leaps can temporarily disrupt any routine."
    },
    {
      q: "When should I be concerned about my baby's development?",
      a: "Consult your pediatrician if your baby: doesn't make eye contact or smile, shows no interest in grabbing toys, cannot hold head steady, doesn't make sounds or coo, or seems unusually stiff or floppy. Most variations are normal, but trust your instincts - you know your baby best!"
    },
    {
      q: "Is it normal for my baby to have irregular breathing patterns during sleep?",
      a: "Yes, periodic breathing (pauses of 5-10 seconds between breaths) is normal. However, seek immediate medical attention if you notice blue lips, consistent rapid breathing, grunting with each breath, or flaring nostrils - these could indicate respiratory issues."
    },
    {
      q: "How can I help with my baby's gas and digestion?",
      a: "Try bicycle legs motion, gentle tummy massage clockwise, upright positioning after feeding, and consider probiotic drops if recommended by your doctor. Most digestive issues improve significantly by 4 months as your baby's system matures."
    },
    {
      q: "When will my baby start babbling more?",
      a: "Around 4 months is when many babies discover their 'voice'! You'll hear more consonant sounds like 'ba,' 'ga,' and 'ma.' Respond enthusiastically to their sounds - this back-and-forth 'conversation' encourages language development and shows them the power of communication."

      title: "The Golden Glow: Welcoming the Fourth Month",
      content: `The first three months of motherhood are often a beautiful, chaotic blur—a whirlwind of round-the-clock feedings, deciphering different cries, and surviving on fragmented sleep. You've been in what many call the "fourth trimester," a period of intense adjustment for both you and your baby.

      But then, something magical happens as you cross the threshold into the fourth month. The fog begins to lift. The intense newborn scream-cries start to morph into more distinct, manageable communications. And your baby, who once seemed like a tiny, sleepy bundle of reflexes, suddenly emerges with a personality.
      
      Month four is widely celebrated as the "golden period" of early infancy. It’s a time when the hard work of the first twelve weeks begins to pay off in tangible, heart-melting ways. Your baby is more alert, more interactive, and finally, you start to see the little person they are becoming. For many mothers, this month brings a profound sense of relief and validation. Feeding becomes smoother, sleep patterns (while not perfect) become slightly more predictable, and you are richly rewarded with genuine, soul-filling laughter and playful interactions.
      
      This isn't to say it's effortless. New developments bring new challenges. But the overwhelming feeling of this month is one of connection and joy. While it's crucial to remember that every single baby develops at their own unique pace, month four is universally a time of exciting, observable changes that lay the foundation for the major physical and cognitive leaps in the months ahead. You're not just surviving anymore; you're starting to truly thrive together.`
    },
    {
      title: "You, The Mother: Nurturing Your Body and Mind",
      content: `As your baby blossoms, so do you. The fourth month postpartum is a significant period of continued physical and emotional evolution.`,
      list: [
        `The Return of Your Energy: You'll likely notice a welcome resurgence in your energy levels. The deep, bone-aching fatigue of the early weeks may be replaced by a more manageable tiredness. Your body has done an incredible amount of healing, and you're feeling stronger. However, be gentle with yourself. Ongoing nighttime waking—even if just once or twice—can still accumulate into a sleep deficit. That "second wind" you get at 9 PM is real, but don't let it trick you into burning the midnight oil. Your body still prioritizes rest.`,

        `The Hair Shedding Phase: Don't be alarmed if you find handfuls of hair on your pillow, in the shower drain, or clinging to your clothes. This is a completely normal, temporary phenomenon. During pregnancy, high estrogen levels kept your hair in the growing phase, resulting in that gorgeous, thick mane. Now, as your hormones stabilize, all that hair that was "on hold" decides to fall out at once. It can feel dramatic, but it typically peaks around month four and should resolve by months six to nine. Your hair will return to its normal growth cycle.`,

        `The C-Section Scar: If you had a Cesarean delivery, you might still experience numbness, tingling, or sensitivity around your scar. This is normal as the nerves slowly regenerate. The scar tissue itself might feel tight or raised. Once your doctor gives you the all-clear (usually at your 6-week check-up), gentle massage can be incredibly beneficial. Using a mild, unscented oil, you can gently massage the area around the scar to improve mobility, reduce sensitivity, and break up adhesions. Always listen to your body and stop if anything feels painful.`,

        `Breastfeeding Stabilizes: For nursing mothers, the fourth month often brings a welcome equilibrium. Your milk supply has fully regulated to meet your baby's demands, which often means an end to painful engorgement and leaking. Feeds become more efficient and predictable; a feed that once took 40 minutes might now be done in 15. You and your baby are a well-practiced team.`,

        `Your Emotional Landscape: Emotionally, this month can be a mixed bag. On one hand, your confidence is likely soaring. You can now distinguish your baby's "I'm hungry" cry from their "I'm tired" whimper. You know what soothes them best. This mastery is empowering. However, as life becomes more predictable, new anxieties can surface. You might start thinking about returning to work, feel the pressure to establish a "perfect" routine, or struggle with balancing your pre-baby identity with your new role as "Mom." These feelings are completely valid. The mild "baby blues" that affected you in the first two weeks should have subsided. If, however, you find yourself feeling persistently sad, hopeless, irritable, or overwhelmed with anxiety, it is critically important to talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. Postpartum depression and anxiety can emerge at any time in the first year, and seeking help is a sign of profound strength and love for both yourself and your baby.`

      title: "Your Amazing Baby: A World of Milestones and Marvels",
      content: `Get ready for a show! Your baby is transforming from a reactive newborn into an active, engaged infant. Here’s what you might witness this month. Remember, these are guidelines, not deadlines. Your baby is on their own unique schedule.`,
      list: [
        `Weight & Growth: The Chubby-Cheeked Champion: By the end of this month, many babies will have doubled their birth weight. This is when those irresistible, pinchable cheeks and thigh rolls really make their appearance. This "baby fat" is not just adorable; it's a crucial energy reserve for all the growing and moving they're about to do.`,

        `Head Control: The World on Their Shoulders: Gone are the days of the wobbly head! Your baby can now hold their head steady and upright when supported in a sitting position. During tummy time, they can push up on their forearms and hold their head at a 90-degree angle, looking around the room with curiosity. This newfound perspective makes tummy time much more enjoyable for them (and for you to watch!).`,

        `Rolling Over: The First Great Journey: Get your cameras ready! The headline event of month four is often the first intentional roll, typically from tummy to back. It takes immense core and neck strength to accomplish this feat. You'll see them during tummy time, rocking side to side, kicking their legs, and then—with a determined grunt—they'll heave themselves over onto their back, often with a look of pure surprise and triumph. This is a monumental milestone, but it also means you can never leave them unattended on a raised surface like a bed or changing table. Their mobility journey has officially begun!`,

        `Hand-Eye Coordination: Reaching and Grabbing: Your baby's hands are no longer mysterious fists that randomly flail. They have discovered them! They'll spend hours staring at their hands, bringing them together, and—most excitingly—using them with purpose. They will swipe at and intentionally grab toys that dangle from a play gym. Once they get a hold of something, it's almost guaranteed to go straight into their mouth. This is their primary way of exploring an object's texture, shape, and taste.`,

        `Language Development: The Coos and Gahs of Conversation: The sweet, simple coos of the previous months are now evolving into more complex sounds. You'll hear a symphony of consonants like "ba," "ga," "ma," and "da," mixed with delightful squeals, growls, and giggles. They are experimenting with their vocal cords and the shape of their mouth. This is the very beginning of speech. The most important thing you can do is talk back! Have a conversation: when they say "ah-goo," you respond with, "Oh, really? Tell me more about that!" This back-and-forth teaches them the fundamental rhythm of communication.`,

        `Social Interaction: Laughter is the Best Medicine: This is the month you may be rewarded with your baby's first real, belly-deep laugh. It's a sound that can erase a sleepless night in an instant. They become incredibly social. They will light up with a full-body wiggle when you enter the room. Games like peek-a-boo become a source of endless amusement because they are starting to understand "object permanence"—the idea that things (and people) still exist even when they can't see them. Your silly faces and exaggerated expressions are the height of comedy to your little one.`,

        `Sleep Patterns: The Longest Stretch Yet: While by no means universal, many babies begin to consolidate their sleep at night around this age, potentially sleeping a glorious 6 to 8-hour stretch. Their circadian rhythms are maturing, and they're taking in more calories during the day. However, this is also the time of the "4-month sleep regression," which is actually a misnomer. It's not a regression at all, but a permanent, biological change in their sleep cycles. Their brain is maturing, and their sleep now cycles between light and deep sleep, just like an adult's. This means they wake up briefly at the end of each cycle. Some babies can self-soothe back to sleep, while others will need your help. This is a normal, healthy developmental stage, not a setback. During the day, they will typically still need 3 to 4 naps to stay well-rested.`

Your baby is a more efficient eater, and you've likely found a rhythm that works for both of you. It's crucial to remember that the official recommendation from major health organizations is to exclusively breastfeed or formula-feed until 6 months of age. While you might see early signs, your baby's digestive system is still maturing.`,

Her eyes were wide with shock for a moment, and then this huge, gummy smile spread across her face. She looked at me as if to say, 'Did you see that?! I did that!' I burst into happy tears. That small, wobbly roll felt like a giant leap for mankind. It was the first tangible proof that my tiny, dependent newborn was growing into a strong, capable little person." — Riya, Delhi`

My son, Ved, started napping at roughly the same times every day. I could finally predict that after his morning feed, he'd be awake for an hour and then need a nap. This predictability was a gift I didn't know I needed. It meant I could shower, eat a proper meal with both hands, or just stare at the wall for ten minutes without a baby in my arms. It gave me back a tiny piece of myself. It didn't mean every day was perfect—far from it—but it meant I had a framework, and that made all the difference." — Meera, Mumbai`

But then it came: a sound I had never heard before. A genuine, deep-from-the-belly, uncontrollable giggle. She laughed so hard she got the hiccups. I did it again, and she laughed again. In that moment, all the fatigue and frustration melted away. That laughter was a reset button for my soul. It reminded me that even in the hardest moments, there is so much pure, unadulterated joy." — Sarah, London`

      list: [
        `An Activity Gym with Hanging Toys: This is a MVP (Most Valuable Product) for this stage. It encourages reaching, batting, grabbing, and visual tracking. Lying under it strengthens their neck and back muscles and provides a safe, engaging spot for them to play while you get a moment.`,

        `Tummy Time Pillow or Mat: A slightly inclined pillow can make tummy time more comfortable and successful by giving them a little boost. Look for mats with high-contrast colors and attached toys to keep them interested.`,

        `Teething Toys: While the first tooth may not appear for another month or two, the teething process begins now. You'll notice excessive drooling and a newfound desire to chomp on everything. Having a few safe, chewable silicone or rubber toys on hand (some that can be chilled in the fridge) can provide immense relief.`,

        `A Stroller with Good Recline and Head Support: Your baby is now alert enough to enjoy short walks outdoors. The sights, sounds, and smells are fantastic sensory stimulation. Ensure your stroller provides adequate support for their neck and spine as they are still building core strength.`,

        `A Wearable Sleep Sack: If you're still swaddling with a traditional blanket, it's time to transition. The moment your baby shows signs of rolling, swaddling becomes a safety risk as it restricts their arm movement, which they need to roll back or adjust their position. A wearable sleep sack or sleep bag keeps them warm and cozy while leaving their arms free for safe movement.`,

        `An Unbreakable Baby Mirror: Babies are fascinated by faces, including their own! A safe, shatter-proof mirror attached to their crib, play gym, or car seat allows them to study their own expressions, which is a key part of social and emotional development.`,

        `Easy-to-Grasp Rattles and Soft Toys: Look for lightweight rattles with thin handles that their small hands can easily hold. The sound provides auditory feedback that rewards their efforts and teaches cause and effect. Soft, crinkly toys are also a huge hit for their sound and texture.`,

        `A Milestone Journal or App: The milestones are coming fast and furious now. The first laugh, the first successful grab, the first roll. It's easy to forget these details in the sleep-deprived haze. Keeping a simple journal or using a milestone tracker app on your phone is a wonderful way to record these precious, fleeting moments.`
