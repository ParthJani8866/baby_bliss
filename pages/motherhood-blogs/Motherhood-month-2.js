  const faqs = [
    {
      q: "How much should my 2-month-old be sleeping?",
      a: "Most 2-month-olds sleep 14-17 hours per day, typically in 2-4 hour stretches. Night sleep may include 2-3 feedings. Daytime naps usually total 4-6 hours spread across 3-4 naps. Remember every baby is different, and growth spurts can temporarily disrupt sleep patterns."
    },
    {
      q: "When should I be concerned about my baby's development?",
      a: "Consult your pediatrician if your baby isn't making eye contact, doesn't respond to loud sounds, can't lift head during tummy time, shows no social smiles by 3 months, or has difficulty feeding. However, most babies develop at their own pace, and temporary variations are normal."
    },
    {
      q: "How can I help my baby with gas and digestion issues?",
      a: "Try bicycle legs motion, gentle tummy massage clockwise, frequent burping during feeds, upright positioning after feeding, and consider probiotic drops if recommended by your doctor. Most digestive issues improve as your baby's system matures around 3-4 months."
    },
    {
      q: "Is it normal for my baby to have irregular breathing patterns?",
      a: "Yes, periodic breathing where babies pause for 5-10 seconds between breaths is normal. However, contact your doctor immediately if you notice blue lips, consistent rapid breathing, grunting with each breath, or flaring nostrils as these could indicate respiratory issues."
    },
    {
      q: "How often should we do tummy time?",
      a: "Aim for 3-5 sessions daily, each lasting 3-5 minutes. Start with shorter sessions after naps or diaper changes when your baby is alert and content. Gradually increase duration as your baby gets stronger. You can also try tummy time on your chest for a more comforting experience."
    },
    {
      q: "When will my baby start sleeping through the night?",
      a: "Most babies aren't developmentally ready for uninterrupted night sleep until 4-6 months. At 2 months, 4-5 hour stretches are considered good night sleep. Focus on establishing consistent bedtime routines rather than expecting full nights of sleep at this age."
    },
    {
      q: "How can I tell if my baby is getting enough milk?",
      a: "Look for 6-8 wet diapers daily, steady weight gain, alertness during awake periods, and contentment after feeds. Breastfed babies should have 3-4 bowel movements daily, while formula-fed babies may have fewer. Your pediatrician will monitor weight gain at check-ups."
    },
    {
      q: "What vaccinations does my baby need at 2 months?",
      a: "The 2-month checkup typically includes DTaP, Hib, PCV13, Polio, and Rotavirus vaccines. Your pediatrician will discuss each vaccine and address any concerns. Prepare for possible fussiness or mild fever afterward, and have infant acetaminophen available if recommended."
