      title: "Month 1-2: The Newborn Adaptation Period",
      content: `The first two months represent a period of incredible adjustment as your baby transitions from the protected womb environment to the outside world. During this time, development focuses on basic survival and sensory integration.`,
      list: [
        `Physical Development: Newborns demonstrate primitive reflexes like the Moro (startle) reflex and rooting reflex. Head control is minimal—when pulled to sit, the head lags considerably. By 2 months, babies may briefly lift their head during tummy time and show less jerky limb movements.`,

        `Visual Development: Newborns see best at 8-12 inches—perfect for studying faces during feeding. They prefer high-contrast patterns and can recognize parents' faces by 1-2 months. Smooth visual tracking emerges around 6-8 weeks.`,

        `Hearing and Communication: Babies startle at loud sounds and are soothed by familiar voices. Early cooing and gurgling begin around 6-8 weeks, and the first social smiles typically emerge during this period, representing a crucial social connection milestone.`,

        `Cognitive Development: Babies begin to recognize familiar routines and may calm when picked up or rocked. They start to understand cause and effect in simple ways, like crying leading to comfort.`
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "Month 3-4: Emerging Social Connection and Control",
      content: `This period marks a delightful shift as babies become more interactive and gain better physical control. The "fourth trimester" ends, and a more predictable routine often emerges.`,
      list: [
        `Motor Skills Development: Head control improves significantly—babies can hold their head steady when supported in sitting position and push up on forearms during tummy time. Hands begin to open more, and babies discover they can bring them to their mouth intentionally.`,

        `Social-Emotional Growth: Smiles become more frequent and directed toward familiar people. Babies begin to enjoy social play and may cry when playing stops. Laughter often emerges around 3-4 months, creating joyful parent-child interactions.`,

        `Communication Advances: Cooing becomes more varied and frequent. Babies begin to make sounds in response to conversation and may imitate facial expressions. They start to distinguish between different emotional tones in voices.`,

        `Cognitive Leaps: Babies become more interested in their environment, turning toward sounds and following moving objects with their eyes. They begin to anticipate familiar routines like feeding or bathing.`

            `Rolling Over: Most babies master rolling from front to back and back to front by 6 months, requiring increased safety measures.`,

            `Sitting Progress: With support, babies can sit steadily. Many begin to sit independently for brief periods by 6 months, though often with a protective "tripod" stance using their arms for support.`,

            `Hand-Eye Coordination: The palmar grasp reflex disappears, replaced by voluntary reaching and grabbing. Babies transfer objects between hands and explore everything with their mouth.`

      content: `This period often brings major breakthroughs in mobility and communication. Babies become increasingly determined to move and interact with their environment in more sophisticated ways.`,
      list: [
        `Mobility Milestones: Many babies begin scooting, crawling, or "combat crawling" (pulling themselves with arms). Some may start pulling to stand with support. Independent sitting becomes secure, freeing hands for play.`,

        `Fine Motor Skills: The pincer grasp (thumb and finger) begins to develop. Babies can rake small objects toward themselves and bang toys together intentionally.`,

        `Language Development: Babbling becomes more speech-like with inflection and rhythm. Babies understand "no" and other common words. Gestural communication expands with pointing, reaching, and waving.`,

        `Cognitive Advances: Problem-solving abilities grow—babies may work to retrieve a hidden toy. They understand simple cause and effect relationships and begin to imitate actions more consistently.`

    {
      title: "Month 9-10: Standing and Early Problem-Solving",
      content: `As the first birthday approaches, babies become increasingly determined to stand upright and engage in more sophisticated problem-solving. This period often involves intense exploration and experimentation.`,
      list: [
        `Physical Achievements: Pulling to stand becomes more confident. Many babies "cruise" along furniture. Some may stand momentarily without support. The pincer grasp becomes more refined, allowing pickup of small objects.`,

        `Communication Skills: Babies may say "mama" or "dada" specifically. They understand simple commands and respond to their name. Gestures become more varied and intentional.`,

        `Cognitive Development: Object permanence is more established—babies will search for hidden objects. They begin to use tools (like using a stick to reach something) and understand simple sequences.`,

        `Social-Emotional Growth: Stranger anxiety may peak. Babies show clear preferences for people and toys. They may test parental responses to behavior and begin to show empathy cues.`

      list: [
        `Mobility Milestones: Many babies take their first independent steps around their first birthday, though this varies widely. Cruising becomes proficient, and sitting down from standing is mastered.`,

        `Language Explosion: Babies use a few words meaningfully and understand many more. They may follow simple one-step commands without gestures. Jabbering with speech-like inflection is common.`,

        `Cognitive Leaps: Problem-solving becomes more sophisticated—babies may try multiple approaches to a challenge. They begin to use objects correctly (brush to hair, cup to drink).`,

        `Social Development: Joint attention improves—babies look where you point and point to share interest. They may show affection to familiar people and exhibit a sense of humor.`

      list: [
        `Responsive Caregiving: Respond promptly to cries and cues. This builds secure attachment and teaches babies that their communication is effective.`,

        `Narrate Your Day: Talk to your baby during routine activities. This exposes them to language patterns and vocabulary in meaningful contexts.`,

        `Read Together Daily: Even young babies benefit from book sharing. Point to pictures and vary your tone to maintain interest.`,

        `Provide "Floor Freedom": Give babies plenty of supervised time on the floor to practice movement skills. Create safe exploration spaces.`,

        `Offer Variated Sensory Experiences: Provide different textures, sounds, and visual experiences. Rotate toys to maintain novelty and interest.`,

        `Sing and Play Games: Simple games like peek-a-boo and patty-cake teach turn-taking and anticipation. Music supports language and emotional development.`,

        `Follow Their Lead: Join in your baby's interests rather than directing all play. This supports engagement and self-direction.`

  const tips = [
    "Create a 'yes' space where your baby can explore safely without constant 'no's—this encourages curiosity and independence.",
    "During tummy time, get down on the floor face-to-face with your baby to make it more engaging and enjoyable.",
    "Narrate your actions throughout the day—this builds language foundation even before your baby understands words.",
    "Respond to your baby's attempts to communicate, whether through sounds, gestures, or facial expressions—this teaches that communication is powerful.",
    "Provide toys that respond to your baby's actions (rattles when shaken, balls that roll) to build cause-effect understanding.",
    "Allow your baby to experience different textures—grass, sand, various fabrics—to support sensory development.",
    "Establish consistent routines—babies thrive on predictability, which supports emotional security.",
    "Take videos, not just photos, to capture the progression of skills and those adorable early vocalizations.",
    "Follow your baby's sleep cues—overtired babies have more difficulty learning and integrating new skills.",
    "Celebrate effort, not just achievement—clap for attempts to reach a toy, not just successful reaches.",
    "Provide containers of various safe household objects for exploration—wooden spoons, silicone cups, fabric scraps.",
    "Use a mirror at baby level—self-recognition develops gradually and provides endless fascination.",
    "Give your baby time to work through minor frustrations—problem-solving builds resilience and cognitive skills.",
    "Connect with other parents—sharing experiences normalizes developmental variations and reduces anxiety.",
    "Trust your instincts—you know your baby best. If something feels concerning, seek professional guidance."

  const faqs = [
    {
      q: "My baby isn't reaching milestones at the exact ages mentioned. Should I be worried?",
      a: "Milestone timelines represent averages, not deadlines. Healthy development occurs within ranges, and many factors influence timing, including personality, birth history, and opportunities for practice. What's more important is steady progression—your baby should continue acquiring new skills over time. Discuss concerns with your pediatrician, but avoid comparing your baby to others or rigid timelines."
    },
    {
      q: "Are there specific toys that best support development in the first year?",
      a: "The best toys are often simple, open-ended, and match your baby's current developmental stage. For young babies: high-contrast cards, rattles, and grasping toys. For 4-8 months: texture balls, stacking cups, and cause-effect toys. For 8-12 months: push toys, shape sorters, and containers for filling/emptying. Remember that everyday household items and most importantly—loving interaction—are more valuable than expensive educational toys."
    },
    {
      q: "How much should I be 'teaching' my baby versus letting them explore naturally?",
      a: "Strike a balance between following your baby's lead and gently introducing new challenges. Babies learn best through self-directed exploration in a rich environment. Your role is to provide opportunities, ensure safety, and respond to your baby's interests. Instead of formal 'teaching,' focus on responsive interaction—comment on what captures their attention, offer variations when they master a skill, and provide just enough help to prevent frustration without taking over."
    },
    {
      q: "Is screen time harmful for infant development?",
      a: "The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no screen time (other than video chatting) for children under 18 months. Babies learn best through hands-on exploration and face-to-face interaction. Screens can interfere with these crucial learning opportunities, disrupt sleep, and potentially impact attention development. Instead of screens, provide real-world sensory experiences, books, and social interaction."
    },
    {
      q: "How can I support development if I have to return to work?",
      a: "Quality matters more than quantity. During time together, focus on being fully present—put away devices, make eye contact, and engage in responsive interaction. Choose caregivers who understand developmental needs and provide plenty of talking, reading, and floor time. Communicate with caregivers about your baby's current interests and emerging skills to maintain consistency. Remember that experiencing different caring styles can actually enrich your baby's social development."
    },
    {
      q: "What's the most important thing I can do to support my baby's development?",
      a: "Build a secure, loving relationship through responsive caregiving. When babies feel safe and connected, they're more confident to explore and learn. This foundation supports all areas of development—cognitive, social, emotional, and physical. Trust your instincts, enjoy the journey, and remember that your loving attention is the most powerful developmental tool available."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I know if my baby is gifted or advanced?",
      a: "It's generally more helpful to focus on supporting your baby's individual development rather than labeling them as 'gifted' in infancy. Some babies develop certain skills earlier than others, but these patterns often even out over time. What's most important is providing a rich, responsive environment that meets your baby at their current level and offers appropriate challenges as they grow."
