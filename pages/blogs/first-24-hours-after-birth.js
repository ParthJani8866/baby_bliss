      title: "The Immediate Postpartum Period: Your Body's Remarkable Transition",
      content: `The first 24 hours after giving birth represent one of the most profound transitions in a woman's life—both physically and emotionally. Your body has just completed the incredible feat of growing and delivering a human being, and now begins the complex process of recovery while simultaneously learning to care for your newborn. This period, often called the 'fourth trimester,' requires immense physical and emotional energy as you navigate healing, hormonal shifts, and the beginnings of your parenting journey.

      Understanding what to expect during these crucial first hours can significantly reduce anxiety and help you make informed decisions about your care and your baby's wellbeing. From the moment of delivery through the first day postpartum, your body undergoes rapid changes while you form those initial precious bonds with your newborn. This comprehensive guide covers everything from physical recovery and medical monitoring to emotional wellbeing and early parenting decisions, providing evidence-based information to empower you during this transformative time.`

      title: "The First Hour After Birth: The Golden Hour of Bonding",
      content: `Immediately following delivery, you and your baby enter what's known as the 'golden hour'—a critical period for bonding, breastfeeding initiation, and physiological stabilization.`,
      list: [
        `Immediate Skin-to-Skin Contact: Your baby will be placed directly on your chest, ideally naked except for a diaper and covered with a warm blanket. This contact helps regulate the baby's temperature, breathing, and heart rate while stimulating your maternal instincts. Research shows that uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact in the first hour improves breastfeeding success and enhances maternal-infant bonding.`,

        `Delayed Cord Clamping: Current guidelines recommend waiting 30-60 seconds before clamping the umbilical cord, which allows extra blood to transfer from the placenta to the baby, providing additional iron stores and stem cells. This simple practice can have significant benefits for your baby's development.`,

        `Early Breastfeeding Attempts: During this period, babies are typically alert and ready to nurse. Your colostrum—the nutrient-rich 'first milk'—provides essential antibodies and nutrition. Even if full milk production hasn't begun, these early nursing sessions establish feeding patterns and provide comfort.`,

        `Initial Physical Assessments: While you bond with your baby, medical staff will conduct essential but minimally invasive checks. Your vital signs will be monitored, and you'll be assessed for excessive bleeding while your baby receives their first Apgar score at one and five minutes after birth.`

          subtitle: "Uterine Changes and Bleeding",
          list: [
            `Lochia Flow: You'll experience vaginal bleeding called lochia, which is typically bright red and similar to a heavy period for the first few days. This is your uterus shedding the lining that supported your pregnancy. Changing pads frequently (every 2-4 hours) and monitoring for unusually large clots (bigger than a plum) is important.`,

            `Afterpains: As your uterus contracts back to its pre-pregnancy size, you may experience cramping similar to menstrual cramps. These 'afterpains' are often more noticeable during breastfeeding when oxytocin release stimulates contractions. They're typically strongest in the first 24-48 hours.`,

            `Uterine Assessment: Nurses will regularly check your fundus (the top of your uterus) to ensure it's firm and contracting properly. This may involve abdominal massage that can be uncomfortable but is essential for preventing hemorrhage.`

          subtitle: "Perineal and Abdominal Recovery",
          list: [
            `Vaginal Delivery Recovery: If you had a vaginal delivery, you may experience perineal soreness, swelling, or discomfort, especially if you had an episiotomy or tearing. Ice packs, witch hazel pads, and sitz baths can provide relief. Your healthcare team will show you how to use a peri-bottle for gentle cleansing.`,

            `Cesarean Section Recovery: For C-section deliveries, you'll have a abdominal incision that requires careful monitoring. You'll initially have limited mobility and will need assistance getting out of bed. The nursing staff will help you manage pain medication and monitor for signs of infection.`,

            `Bladder and Bowel Function: You may experience difficulty urinating initially due to swelling or anesthesia effects. Drinking plenty of fluids and using techniques like running water can help. Bowel movements might be delayed due to hormonal changes, dehydration, or fear of pain.`

            `Bleeding Assessment: Healthcare providers will monitor your lochia flow and uterine firmness to identify postpartum hemorrhage risks. Excessive bleeding (soaking a pad in less than an hour) requires immediate attention.`,

            `Pain Management: Your pain levels will be assessed regularly, and appropriate medications will be offered. Effective pain control is essential for mobility, breastfeeding, and bonding.`,

            `Incision Care: If you had a C-section or perineal repair, staff will regularly check your incision for signs of infection, proper healing, or hematoma formation.`

            `Apgar Scoring: Conducted at one and five minutes after birth, this quick assessment evaluates your baby's heart rate, breathing, muscle tone, reflexes, and color. Most babies score between 7-10, with lower scores indicating possible need for medical support.`,

            `Comprehensive Physical Exam: Within the first 24 hours, a pediatrician or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination checking for any physical abnormalities, assessing neurological function, and ensuring all systems are functioning properly.`,

            `Newborn Screening Tests: Your baby will have a heel prick blood test to screen for various genetic, metabolic, and endocrine disorders. Early detection allows for prompt treatment of conditions that could otherwise cause developmental issues.`,

            `Vitamin K Injection: This routine injection helps prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding, a serious but preventable condition that can occur in newborns.`,

            `Eye Antibiotic Ointment: Most states require erythromycin ointment application to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum, a serious eye infection that can be transmitted during birth.`

      title: "Feeding Your Newborn: Establishing Nutrition",
      content: `The first 24 hours are crucial for establishing feeding patterns, whether you choose breastfeeding, formula feeding, or a combination.`,
      list: [
        `Breastfeeding Initiation: Early and frequent nursing stimulates milk production and helps your baby learn to latch effectively. Colostrum—your first milk—is concentrated nutrition packed with antibodies. Even small amounts provide significant benefits. Most newborns feed 8-12 times in 24 hours.`,

        `Latch and Positioning: Proper latch is essential for effective feeding and preventing nipple pain. Seek help from lactation consultants available in most hospitals. Different positions like cradle hold, cross-cradle, or football hold can make feeding more comfortable.`,

        `Feeding Cues: Learn to recognize early hunger signs like rooting, hand-to-mouth movements, and increased alertness. Crying is a late hunger cue—responding earlier often makes feeding easier.`,

        `Formula Feeding Support: If you're formula feeding, hospital staff can provide guidance on proper preparation, pacing, and amounts. Newborns typically take 1-2 ounces per feeding in the first 24 hours.`,

        `Output Monitoring: What goes in must come out! Expect 1-2 wet diapers and at least one meconium (dark, tarry) stool in the first 24 hours. This output indicates your baby is feeding effectively.`

      title: "Emotional and Psychological Transitions",
      content: `The emotional experience of the first 24 hours can range from euphoria to overwhelm as you process the birth experience and adjust to your new role.`,
      list: [
        `The Birth High: Many women experience a surge of euphoria and excitement immediately after delivery, driven by hormones like oxytocin and endorphins. This natural high can make you feel energized despite physical exhaustion.`,

        `Baby Blues Onset: As hormone levels rapidly shift, you may experience mood swings, tearfulness, or anxiety. These 'baby blues' are normal and typically peak around days 3-5 postpartum.`,

        `Processing the Birth Experience: Whether your delivery matched your birth plan or took unexpected turns, processing this experience is important. Talking through what happened with your partner or healthcare providers can help with emotional integration.`,

        `Bonding Variations: While media often portrays instant, overwhelming connection, bonding can develop gradually. Some mothers feel immediate deep connection, while others need time to develop these feelings—both are normal.`,

        `Overwhelm and Vulnerability: The responsibility of caring for a newborn, combined with physical recovery and sleep deprivation, can feel overwhelming. Accepting help and acknowledging these feelings is healthy and normal.`

      content: `Understanding typical hospital procedures can help you navigate the first 24 hours more comfortably.`,
      list: [
        `Rooming-In Options: Most hospitals encourage 'rooming-in,' where your baby stays with you rather than in a nursery. This promotes bonding and breastfeeding but can be exhausting. Don't hesitate to ask nursery staff for brief periods of care so you can rest.`,

        `Visitor Management: Establish clear boundaries about visitors. While loved ones are excited to meet the new baby, excessive visitors can interfere with resting and bonding. Consider limiting visits to immediate family initially.`,

        `Documentation and Paperwork: You'll need to complete birth certificate information, social security applications, and other documentation. Many hospitals offer this service in your room to minimize disruption.`,

        `Hospital Staff Rotations: Different nurses, lactation consultants, and pediatric staff will care for you throughout your stay. Don't hesitate to ask questions repeatedly—each provider may offer slightly different but valuable perspectives.`,

        `Personal Care Items: Pack comfort items from home—your own pillow, toiletries, comfortable clothing, and snacks can make the hospital experience more pleasant. Most hospitals provide basic postpartum supplies, but having familiar items helps.`

    {
      title: "Partner and Support Person Role",
      content: `Your support person plays a crucial role in navigating the first 24 hours and advocating for your needs.`,
      list: [
        `Advocacy and Communication: Your partner can help communicate your preferences to medical staff, especially when you're tired or overwhelmed. They can ensure your birth plan preferences are respected where possible.`,

        `Practical Support: From fetching ice chips during labor to managing visitors and taking photos, practical support allows you to focus on recovery and bonding. Partners can also help with diaper changes, swaddling, and soothing techniques.`,

        `Emotional Support: The emotional presence of a supportive partner provides comfort and reassurance during this vulnerable time. Simple gestures like holding your hand, offering encouragement, or acknowledging your strength mean tremendously.`,

        `Learning Together: Partners should participate in baby care education provided by hospital staff. Learning diapering, swaddling, and soothing techniques together builds confidence for both parents.`,

        `Self-Care for Partners: Support people need to remember their own needs—eating regularly, taking breaks, and getting rest when possible helps them provide better support.`

            `Signs of Infection: Fever above 100.4°F, foul-smelling discharge, or increasing pain at incision sites could indicate infection.`,

            ` Pre-eclampsia Symptoms: Severe headache, visual changes, upper abdominal pain, or sudden swelling in hands and face warrant urgent evaluation.`,

  const faqs = [
    {
      q: "How much bleeding is normal in the first 24 hours after birth?",
      a: "Heavy bleeding similar to a heavy menstrual period is normal initially. You might soak a pad every 2-4 hours. Passing some clots (up to the size of a plum) is common, but larger clots or soaking a pad in less than an hour requires immediate medical attention. The bleeding should gradually decrease over the first day."
    },
    {
      q: "When will my milk come in after delivery?",
      a: "Your body produces colostrum immediately after birth—this thick, yellowish fluid is packed with nutrients and antibodies. Mature milk typically 'comes in' between 2-5 days postpartum. In the first 24 hours, your baby only needs small amounts of colostrum, which is exactly what your body produces. Frequent nursing helps stimulate milk production."
    },
    {
      q: "Is it normal to feel shaky or have chills after giving birth?",
      a: "Yes, many women experience shaking or chills immediately after delivery. This is usually related to hormonal shifts, adrenaline release, and the physical exertion of labor. It typically resolves within an hour or two. If shaking persists or is accompanied by fever, mention it to your healthcare provider."
    },
    {
      q: "How often should my newborn feed in the first 24 hours?",
      a: "Newborns typically feed 8-12 times in 24 hours, which means every 2-3 hours. Watch for early hunger cues like rooting, hand-to-mouth movements, and increased alertness rather than waiting for crying. Even if feedings are brief, frequent nursing helps establish milk supply and provides comfort."
    },
    {
      q: "When will I be able to get out of bed and walk after delivery?",
      a: "After an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, most women can walk to the bathroom within a few hours. After a C-section, you'll typically be encouraged to stand and take a few steps within 8-12 hours with assistance. Early mobility helps prevent blood clots and promotes recovery, but listen to your body and don't push too hard."
    },
    {
      q: "What pain relief options are available during the first 24 hours?",
      a: "Pain management depends on your delivery method. After vaginal delivery, ibuprofen and acetaminophen are typically offered, along with ice packs for perineal discomfort. After C-section, you'll receive stronger pain medication, often through an IV initially, then transitioning to oral medications. Don't hesitate to ask for pain relief—managing discomfort helps you rest and bond with your baby."
    },
    {
      q: "How can I help my partner bond with the baby in the first 24 hours?",
      a: "Partners can practice skin-to-skin contact, participate in diaper changes and swaddling, help with feeding (whether offering a bottle or bringing the baby to breastfeed), and simply hold the baby while you rest. Many partners find their confidence grows through hands-on care with guidance from hospital staff."
    },
    {
      q: "When should I call for help from the nursing staff?",
      a: "Call for help for: excessive bleeding, severe pain not relieved by medication, signs of infection (fever, foul discharge), breathing difficulties, concerns about your baby's feeding or behavior, or if you're feeling emotionally overwhelmed. Hospital staff expect frequent calls—it's better to ask than to worry."
